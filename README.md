# NFe Analytics

NFe Analytics is a simple, client-side web application designed to parse Brazilian invoice files and provide easy-to-understand analytics. The application is built to help small business owners, like my dad, who find traditional ERPs too complicated to use.

## Features

- No server-side code or third-party services involved, making it completely secure and privacy-friendly.
- Analyzes invoice files without uploading or sharing your data.
- Provides a clean user interface for selecting date ranges, products, and clients.
- Displays the total sales, sales by product, and sales by client in a clear and concise manner.

## Hosted Version
